Follow detailed instructions provided specifically for this example. 

Select the instructions depending on Espressif chip installed on your development board:

- [ESP32 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/index.html)
- [ESP32-S2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html)


## Example folder contents

The project contains one source file in C language [app_main.c](main/app_main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt` files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets (executable, library, or both). 

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure

    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.
